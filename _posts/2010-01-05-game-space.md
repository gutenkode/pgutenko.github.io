This was my final project for a class about the portrayal space in media, and especially in film.  I decided to try and capture the feel of a classic 3D rail shooter for my project instead of a short video.  The level geometry is almost all flat shaded, and a CRT screen filter is applied to give the appearance of playing on an old, low-resolution monitor.

Disclaimer: being a Starfox fangame of sorts, this project is currently using a handful of models and texture resources from the Starfox games - specifically models from Starfox 64 and backgrounds from Starfox 2.
