Frankly, I don't know why anyone hasn't thought of this sooner.  This game was originally made as a Christmas gift for a Secret Santa party - instead of just shooting at aliens, you need to launch the Falcon 5 rocket at them!  Of course, you need to catch the rocket on the landing pad as it falls, too.  A short and sweet arcade game.
