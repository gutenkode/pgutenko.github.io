The Mote engine is what powers most of my games and graphics projects.  Written in Java and using OpenGL, it supports all three major desktop OSes as well as Android.  I created it because I was frustrated at the lack of transparency in modern game engines - building the code for my games from the ground up was an excellent way to learn about and optimize the systems that power modern games.
<br><br>
The focus of Mote is bare-bones efficiency, mostly consisting of a large collection of tools for automating common rendering and logic tasks in games.  A new project in Mote requires almost no custom boilerplate to be written before diving right into the full power of OpenGL.  Good knowledge of the workings of OpenGL is necessary to use it.
