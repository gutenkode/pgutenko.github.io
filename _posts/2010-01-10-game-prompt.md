Prompt is a simple, clean, hardcore platformer.  It was made in Java using LWJGL and OpenGL, and is powered by my own custom-built game engine Mote.  It makes heavy use of shaders and postprocessing effects to give the impression of an old DOS-era command prompt.  The gameplay is not for the faint of heart... check it out on Steam!

I am currently building a verion of this game for Android!  Details to follow when it's ready.
