A group project between me, Audrey Randall, Chance Roberts, and Tarah Peltz.  The goal of the project was to design and implement a complex project using design patterns.  Our final product ended up being a huge success!  Collaboration between the four of us produced a well-designed game engine and set of graphical assets.
